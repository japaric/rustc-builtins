// On most modern Intel and AMD processors, "rep movsq" and "rep stosq" have
// been enhanced to perform better than an simple qword loop, making them ideal
// for implementing memcpy/memset. Note that "rep cmps" has received no such
// enhancement, so it is not used to implement memcmp.
//
// On certain recent Intel processors, "rep movsb" and "rep stosb" have been
// further enhanced to automatically select the best microarchitectural
// implementation based on length and alignment. See the following features from
// the "IntelÂ® 64 and IA-32 Architectures Optimization Reference Manual":
//  - ERMSB - Enhanced REP MOVSB and STOSB (Ivy Bridge and later)
//  - FSRM - Fast Short REP MOV (Ice Lake and later)
//  - Fast Zero-Length MOVSB (On no current hardware)
//  - Fast Short STOSB (On no current hardware)
// However, to avoid run-time feature detection, we don't use these byte-based
// instructions for most of the copying, preferring the qword variants.
